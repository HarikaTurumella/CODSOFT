Task 1: NUMBER GAME using Java Programming.
This program initializes a random number as the secret number and prompts the user to input their guesses. 
It provides feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high until the correct number is guessed.
This loop is continued if the user wanted to play more rounds and the total score is displayed at the end.
